${{ content_comparison }}

**Why is this image not distroless?** I would have loved to create a distroless, single binary image, sadly the way that Sonarr is setup makes it really difficult to compile a static binary from source. Enabling AOT breaks almost 30% of used libraries because they are not setup to be statically linked (like Assembly.GetExecutingAssembly().Location). It’s also not fixable with a single PR. This is something the Sonarr team would need to do.
